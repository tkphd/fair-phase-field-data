This presentation builds heavily on the work of Andrea Medina-Smith,
especially the slides for "FAIR Principles for Data Sponsors" by
Andrea Medina-Smith and Trevor Keller, delivered 2 May 2022 for a
NIST-internal team.

Exercises use the excellent [ARDC Self-Assessment][ardc] and
[F-UJI Automated Assessment][fuji] to gauge FAIR-ness of a resource.
